<h1>Mark Pomery</h1>
<p>RMIT Student Number: S3923312.</p>
<p>Email: S3923312@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<p>My name is Mark, I’m from Western Australia, currently living in New South Wales with my wife and daughter. I have a British heritage and English is my spoken language. I have previously served in the Australian defence force as an infantry soldier and have spent 10 years as a Surveying Technician in the mining industry with other roles in between including new and used vehicle sales, portable fire systems technician, warehousing and security. I love playing soccer and am a social Manchester United supporter. </p>

<h2>Interst in IT</h2> 
<p>I became interested in IT in high school, studying computer animation, technical drawing and computer studies subjects. My other interests were in the military and all things Army related which led me to my defence service. I have always loved playing video games with friends and have been interested in the technology behind it since the 90’s with the early game consoles. I have built my own custom PC for gaming purposes and have strived to update it whenever practical. I have current user level experience troubleshooting network and information/software systems at my current and previous roles whenever breakdowns or issues arise but have held no other professional IT related positions.</p>
<p>I chose to study with RMIT because I wanted to study a broader range of IT related subjects and not restrict myself to one field of work in the long term. I considered the subjects on offer and the reputation RMIT has and decided it was the best option for me. I have worked in the mining industry for a considerable amount of time and wanted to gain qualifications to provide myself other work opportunities when moving within or away from the mining industry.</p>
<p>While studying at RMIT I expect to gain the knowledge and skills I need to get the employment I’m looking for, across a wide range of subjects which will allow me to be multi skilled across the spectrum of IT related jobs and best arm me for the workforce and future career. I am hoping to gain experience in cloud computing and networking and build a greater knowledge of programming to allow me not only to take on a new job and job industry but also to help me gain the necessary knowledge to complete other hobby type tasks or interest such as game development and home automation.</p>
